Briefly describe your system (e.g. A store selling Pokemon game cards)<br>
**My system is a store selling funko pops, keychains, and t-shirts.**

Any notable shortcomings, bugs, problems, or additional features not implemented?<br>
**Yes, some shortcomings or features that I was not able to implement was a better interface for the invoice and cart. Unfortunately, I ran out of time to implement more css.**

Describe what you are most proud of about your system: <br>
**What I am most proud about my system is that I can transfer data between the pages through cookies. I am most proud of this because I struggled with understanding how cookies worked.**

Describe what you are least happy with your system: <br>
**What I am least happy with my system is the user interface because I wanted to change it up to be more aesthetically pleasing. However, I did not have the time to do so for this assignment.**

How was developing this assignment different than assignment #2? <br>
**I developed this assignment differently than assignment #2 by planning out what I needed to do first instead of just diving into the assignment.**

When you ran into a problem, what did you do to address it? <br>
**When I ran into a problem, I addressed it by meeting with Professor Port for help. In addition, I asked my peers for help.**

Describe what worked well in doing this assignment? <br>
**Something that worked well in doing this assignment was implementing the transition between pages.**

Describe what did not work well in doing this assignment? <br>
**Something that did not work well in doing this assignment was figuring out how to transfer data between pages. It took very long since I didn't have a good understanding of cookies initially.**

What did you learn from doing this assignment? <br>
**What I learned from doing this assignment was how to transfer data between pages through cookies, how to send a confirmation email to users, and how to create a navbar.**

If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you change? <br>
**If I could go back in time and do things differently, I would start earlier and dedicate more time. I took a week off before starting assignment 3 which gave me 2 weeks. If I could do it over again, I would not have tooken a week off and instead dived into the assignment.**

Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging <br>
**I spent 40% of the time thinking about what I need to do, 40% writing the code, and 20% testing and debugging.**

Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself) and explain briefly your rationale for the percentage breakdown. Be sure to include an overview of what specifically you and your partners contributed (e.g. “I worked on the security and my partner 1 worked on personalization”)<br>
**This did not apply to me. I did everything myself since I did not work in a group.**
