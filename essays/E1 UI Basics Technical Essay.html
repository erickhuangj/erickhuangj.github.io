  <p>For Browser History 1, we created a html file containing texts about different browsers. Then we formatted the file so that it displayed images of the browsers.</p>

<p>For the first WOD, it took me about 1 hour to finish since I was becoming familiar with using the languages such as CSS and HTML. For this WOD, I learned how to structure documents into subsections and to create external links within the sections. In addition, I was able to create a table of contents where I created itemized lists. Lastly, I created logo displays to give an image of the text.</p>

<p>Some struggles that I faced with BrowserHistory1 was how to screen record. I am on a macbook so I used quicktime player. If you choose to record this way, please make sure that audio is also being recorded alongside your screen recording. This took me about 2 tries. For both recordings of my WOD 1 it only took about 15 minutes. I practiced the code through the instructions first then decided to watch the video after attempting it by myself. I believe that this helps you memorize and learn the process better, therefore creating better results.</p>

<p>In Browser History 2, we styled our site with elements through css.</p>

<p>For my second WOD, it took me about 40 minutes total to complete. Browser history 2 took me about 5 minutes in the recording to complete. This WOD was easier to complete since it was only incorporating CSS. One very useful guide to completing this WOD is to read through the css guide that is linked in the modules. It gives you all the commands to fulfill the task. One part that I struggled with was creating Oswald and Open Sans font. Only when I watched the video did I realize that we had to search up the fonts on google dev. Changing the font colors and margins should be pretty easy as long as you follow the instructions and read the manual. The only tricky part could be remembering that CSS uses { symbols.</p>

<p>In Browser History 3, we created separate sections and a navigation bar.</p>

<p>For my third WOD, this took me about an hour. One of the issues that I ran into was that I did not know how to create the side-by-side sections and the navigation bar. Although the content was less to cover, it was very complex. Creating different classes in html requires you to use a “.” in the beginning before you style the element in css. In addition, another challenging component of this section was learning the different css tags such as float, width, and padding. Lastly, after running through the WOD by myself, I referred to the video and then recorded it twice.</p>
