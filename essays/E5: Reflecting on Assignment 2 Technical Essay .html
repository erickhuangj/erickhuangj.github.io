  <p>Provide a brief introduction to the assignment along with a link to this page for further details <br />
<strong>For this brief introduction, we created a store where users could purchase different products. For this assignment specifically, I implemented a registration and log-in page for users so that their data could be stored on file.</strong></p>

<p>What did you learn from this assignment? <br />
<strong>During this assignment, I learned how to write files into a JSON file and to retrieve that data. In addition, I learned how to store and retrieve data from a server.</strong></p>

<p>Did you work with a partner? Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself). <br />
<strong>I did not work with a partner, so I contributed 100% to my assignment.</strong></p>

<p>How did you get help when you needed it? What did you need help with? <br />
<strong>I got help when I needed it by reaching out to Professor Port. In addition, I reached out to my peers and asked questions on how to do the assignment. I needed help with certain validation stuff for my registration and log-in page. Also for my Individual requirement, I had to implement a log-in count and log-in date.</strong></p>

<p>How was developing this assignment different than assignment #1? <br />
<strong>Developing this assignment was different than assignment #1 in the way that I was adding onto something I already built. Whereas for assignment #1, I had to start from zero. In addition, a lot of the work from assignment #2 used concepts that we touched on in assignment #1.</strong></p>

<p>Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging <br />
<strong>I spent about 40% of the time thinking about how to do the project. I spent about 20% time writing code. The remaining 40% was spent testing and debugging. I spent the least time writing code because there was not much to add, however, there would be errors so I would spend a lot of time debugging my code.</strong></p>

<p>Describe what worked well with this project? What did not work well? <br />
<strong>What worked well with this project was meeting with the Professor and troubleshooting through my problems. Some things that did not work well was working on the assignment before reading the manual and just trying to type code. In addition, working when I was feeling tired did not contribute to progress.</strong></p>

<p>If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you do differently? <br />
<strong>If I could go back in time and do things differently, I would start the assignment earlier and ask the Professor for more help. In addition, I would reach out to my peers more and ask for help.</strong></p>
