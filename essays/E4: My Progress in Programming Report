My programming skills have greatly improved in the following ways:
I believe that my programming skills have greatly improved in the following ways by coming to class and listening to Professor Port. In addition, attending Professor Port's office hours have been crucial as I get a chance to speak one on one. Another useful thing was collaborating with my peers on the assignments and labs. In addition to this, asking those who have taken the class before for help on the labs were important.   

I need to work on the following to improve my programming skills:
Things I need to work on in order to improve my programming skills are reading the manual more and in depth. In addition, I should try work on the problems more by myself before asking for help. I think that would let me understand the content more. 

I have learned a lot from doing WODs and I can do them without copying the screencast:
Yes, I truly believe the WODs have been crucial to my understanding of certain labs. I do not agree that I can do them without copying the screencast. I am able to do most parts, however, there are generally chunks that I do not understand even after trying a couple times so I end up watching the screencast. 

The labs have help me learn and I am able to complete them with confidence:
I partially agree, the labs do help me learn a lot, however, I do not believe I can complete them with confidence. The labs feel a little overwhelming at times and I have to spend a lot of time in order to complete them. 

I learned a lot from my experience doing Assignment 1 and feel ready to work on Assignment 2:
I agree. Assignment 1 was very challenging, however, meeting with Professor Port during office hours was very crucial to completing the assignment. I feel ready to work on Assignment 2, however, the length of time given for the assignment does worry me. 

I think the class can be improved to help my learning in the following ways:
The class can be improved to help my learning by implementing more video screencasts since I am a visual learner. It is hard for myself to learn conceptually. 

What helps me the most in class are (WODs, Labs, class website, screencasts, readings, quizzes, one on one help, working with classmates, etc.):
What helps me the most in class are the one on one help and working with classmates. I think that without either of these, I would not have been able to complete Assignment 1.
