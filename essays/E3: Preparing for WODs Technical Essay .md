In the WOD “Invoice 1” we are tasked to create an invoice with at least five different products. Attached is a link to the WOD page for further detailing.

So far my experiences that went well in performing the WOD was following the code within the instructions provided. What I stumbled on was figuring out the formula to calculate the subtotal, sales tax, and total. This took me a while to figure out, however, the main error was not having the script tags before and after the code.

In order to prepare, I searched up topics on how to create a table. What I did similarily from previous WODs was reading all of the instructions before starting. Something that I did differently this WOD around was I actually referenced the video before to figure out how to create the table. Usually, I attempt the whole WOD before watching the video. 

Something I could do to be better prepared next time is research more topics related to the WOD. Something I will do differently next time is ask others for help on the WOD when I need to, since teamwork is essential.
